# Churn Probability Prediction with Machine Learning

Welcome to the Churn Probability Prediction repository! This project focuses on predicting customer churn using various machine learning techniques. Customer churn refers to the loss of clients or customers, and predicting it is crucial for businesses to take preemptive actions to retain customers.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate machine learning models that can predict the probability of customer churn. By understanding the factors that contribute to churn, businesses can develop strategies to improve customer retention and increase profitability.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature encoding, and scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data to uncover patterns and correlations.
- **Model Building**: Implementing various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters for better performance.
- **Feature Importance**: Identifying the most influential features contributing to churn.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for the analysis.
